<p>"Officers," says a recent A.C.I., "may use their public chargers
for general purposes." Army circles regard this as a body blow at
the taxi-sharks.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>"I had a thrill the other night," writes a correspondent of
<i>The Daily Mail.</i> "I encountered a badger on Hampstead Heath."
We hesitate to think what he would have encountered if he had had
two or three thrills.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>The United States Immigration Bill now before Congress provides
that "an alien resident may be joined by his grandfather if over
fifty-five years of age." A proposal to extend the privilege to
great-grandfathers who have turned their sixtieth year appears to
have met with no success.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>"It is highly probable," says the chief medical officer of the
Local Government Board, "that masks and goggles will be necessary
to ensure freedom from infection from influenza." People who refuse
to adopt this simple preventative should be compelled by law to
breathe exclusively through their ears.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>The sensational report that the new Director-General of Housing
has already found a house turns out to be unfounded. It is no
secret, however, that the Department is on the track of
several.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>"There is a Members' cloak-room," says a contemporary in "Hints
to M.P.'s," "where an attendant will take your coat and hat." So
different from those other political clubs where another member
usually takes them.</p>

<p>SHAKSPEARE on Glasgow: "For this relief much tanks.".</p>

<p>The salute, says a correspondent, is being reintroduced into the
German Army. Kicking an officer on the parade-ground for other than
political reasons is also forbidden.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>The Consumers' Council urge, <i>inter alia,</i> "that the Food
Ministry ought to be retained so long as there is any need of food
control." This view is regarded as entirely too narrow by officials
of the Ministry, who feel that the public is just beginning to love
them for themselves alone.</p>

<p>A sale of ninety specially-selected mules is announced to take

<h3>A LOVE TRAGEDY.</h3>
<p>He was a smart new clinical thermometer. She was a pretty nurse
in an influenza ward. His figurings were clear and his quicksilver
glittered. Her eyes were blue and a little curl peeped from under
her cap. He fell madly in love with her; and when her dainty
fingers toyed with him his little heart swelled to bursting and he
registered all he could.</p>
<p>So when she took her morning temperatures her patients were
desperately high, and when the other nurse took them in the evening
they were three degrees lower; and the doctors were much
perplexed.</p>
<p>They put the love-struck thermometer in a tumbler of warm water
with two others to test him; and, freed from her influence, he
recorded correctly. Learned authorities on medical research
meditated pamphlets, on the new variation of the universal
plague.</p>
<p>Then came a morning when the pretty nurse, after too many
cigarettes the night before, took her own temperature. For the
adoring thermometer the supreme moment had arrived. In rapturous
ecstasy at the touch of her dear lips he rose to heights of
exaltation that left his other efforts far behind. "Drat the
thing," exclaimed the pretty nurse, putting him down nastily, "I've
got it myself now," and went off to bed. He, broken-hearted, rolled
off the table and died.</p>
<hr />
<h3>LONG MEMORIES.</h3>
<p>"I remember," said a veteran of nineteen, "when there was a
hansom at the stand at the corner."</p>
<p>"Oh, that's nothing," said a venerable spinster of twenty-one.
"I've been, to dances with a female chaperon where there was no
smoking on the stairs, and some people danced a thing they called a
'tango.'"</p>
<p>"When I was working on the land," resumed the first speaker, "I
had a day off and went to lunch with people close by. The man who
sat next me was a judge and asked me what an 'old bean' meant."</p>
<p>"Oh, cut it out!" interposed an aged matron who had not hitherto
taken any part in the conversation. "When I was born there was no
<i>Daily Mail,</i> when I went to school I was taught to play the
piano with my fingers, and when I married people hadn't begun to
'jazz.'"</p>

<h2>EDENTULOUS PERSONS.</h2>
<p>It happened a long time ago. Higgins, Mackenzie and I, three
irresponsible subalterns, had been lent to the Government of India
for famine relief work. One Sunday we foregathered in the cool of
the evening at a dak bungalow, near the point where our three
districts met, to compare notes and to swap lies.</p>
<p>"How are you getting on?" I asked Higgins.</p>
<p>"I'm not getting on at all. I'm just stagnating. I do all my
work and draw my pay, and there's the end of it. I'm sure the
regiment has forgotten all about me, and in fact no one seems to be
aware of my existence."</p>
<p>"Why not write to the Government of India about it?" remarked
Mackenzie.</p>
<p>"Yes, I'm sure that's the best thing to do," I agreed. "The
Collector in my district is always writing to the Government of
India, and the Government prints all he writes and sends it round
with remarks and decisions. He will get all sorts of honours and
rewards out of this famine."</p>
<p>"Yes. But what shall I write?" asked Higgins. "If I simply say
there is a chap called Higgins who is terribly bored and wants some
notice taken of him, they won't print that sort of tosh."</p>
<p>"Not that particular kind of tosh, perhaps," agreed Mackenzie.
"You've got to write about your work and ask for a decision on some
point or other. Then they'll remember your existence; and if you
write often enough you will gradually crawl out of obscurity into
the limelight. Almost anything will do to start with."</p>
<p>"Well, I found an old woman to-day in one of my camps who could
not eat her ration, because she had no teeth. Can you make anything
out of that?" asked Higgins.</p>
<p>"We'll have a shot at it anyway," replied Mackenzie. He pulled a
sheet of note-paper and a pencil out of his pocket and wrote the
following draft:&mdash;"There are in the famine camps in my area
some toothless old people who cannot eat the ordinary ration. What
shall I do about it?"</p>
<p>"The gist of the letter is all right," I said, "but the style
wants polishing. Higgins's education will be gauged by our style.
Cross out 'some toothless old people' and write 'certain edentulous
persons.' Put 'masticate' instead of 'eat.' Then you must not say,
'What shall I do about it?' That sounds too helpless. You, or
rather Higgins, must appear as a man of unbounded initiative and
resource. You must write, 'I suggest that a special ration of soft
food be issued to such persons.' That will help the Government of
India to solve a very difficult problem, and Higgins will earn its
eternal gratitude."</p>
<p>The amendments were passed unanimously. Higgins copied out the
letter in his best handwriting and sent it off through the long and
winding channels by which subalterns on famine duty communicate
with the heaven-born ones who sit on the far-off hills.</p>
<p>We separated next day, and I forgot all about the matter until
three weeks later, when, going through my official mail, the name
Patrick Aloysius Higgins caught my eye. There was our letter
printed in full, and below it was the epoch-making decision of the
Government: "A special ration of soft food may be issued to
edentulous persons in famine camps."</p>
<p>Higgins's success evidently provoked Mackenzie to emulate it.
Some time later I received another printed document. After the
usual official opening, with its reference numbers, etc., it ran as
follows: "There are in the famine camps in this area certain
persons who, though not edentulous, are yet unable to masticate the
ordinary ration. Though they have some teeth, the teeth are all in
one jaw. May such persons be considered as edentulous for the
purposes of the decision referred to above? Signed, JAMES DOUGLAS
MACKENZIE." The Government was again pleased to record its
approval.</p>
<p>The letter roused my jealousy. Higgins and Mackenzie, by the use
of my distinguished literary style, had both got well along the
road to fame, whilst I was still languishing in obscurity.
Something must be done about it. I took a pen and wrote: "There are
in the famine camps in this area certain persons who, though they
are not edentulous and though they have some teeth in both jaws,
are yet unable to masticate the ordinary ration because the teeth
in the upper jaw correspond with the gaps in the lower, and <i>vice
versa</i>. May such persons be considered as edentulous for the
purposes of the two previous decisions?"</p>
<p>I sent the letter off to the Government of India. The reply came
by return of post:&mdash;</p>
<p>"The Government of India, in response to representations, has
authorised the issue of a special ration of soft food to edentulous
persons in famine camps. In the interpretation of the term
'edentulous' considerable latitude may be permitted, and is indeed
desirable, so that it may in practice be applied to many
individuals who, according to meticulous physiological standards,
should not be so classified. The determining factor in the
application of the term should be the inability of the individual
concerned to extract sufficient nutriment from the normal ration,
owing to imperfect mastication. Such persons will invariably
exhibit symptoms of mal-nutrition or cacotrophy.</p>
<p>"The Government is confident that the foregoing general ruling
will enable junior and inexperienced officers, temporarily employed
on famine duty, to classify appropriately and with facility as
denticulate or edentulous all individuals afflicted with dental
hiatus, mal-conformation and labefaction, without further reference
to higher authority."</p>
<p>As I read the letter with the help of a dictionary, it dawned
upon me that the Government of India had won the game beyond all
doubt and peradventure.</p>

<h2>THE PATRIOT PIG.</h2>
<p>Last Spring I was discussing food with our local doctor. Last
Spring it was quite a favourite topic.</p>
<p>"Now," I said, "we can manage to scratch along somehow. But next
year . . ."</p>
<p>The Doctor, a hearty man, gave me a smashing blow on the
shoulder. "I have it!" he trumpeted. "We'll start a Patriot Pig
Club."</p>
<p>Before he left I found myself an important pillar of the scheme.
Pillars, you know, are the parts of an edifice that bear the
weight. Their function is to be sat upon by the arches. In this
case the arches were Jones the doctor and Perkins the butcher.</p>
<p>The Committee began sitting. I put five pounds into the
preliminary pool and promised them all my pig-swill. I know I did,
because the Doctor came straight from the meeting to my house to
tell me I had, and to collect the cheque.</p>
<p>The pigs arrived. I myself and a number of other enthusiasts
turned out to welcome them. The Doctor, I remember, made a happy
little speech, and we all laughed a lot. The Committee were very
pleased with themselves. They <i>were</i> dear little
chaps&mdash;the pigs, I mean&mdash;very small, of course, but that
gave me the opening for what was undoubtedly the most successful
sally of the afternoon. Someone said they weighed five pounds
apiece. "One pound per pound," I remarked.</p>
<p>A week later the Doctor called for my second instalment. "Pig
going strong," he chattered gaily while I wrote out the cheque;
"best of a good litter&mdash;bust its pink ribbon yesterday; twice
the weight it was when it came."</p>
<p>It was on the tip of my tongue to repeat my witticism, which was
still true, but I refrained.</p>
<p>I paid the first dozen five-pound instalments without comment.
Up till then I had been fully occupied in studying how FOCH was
getting on with the other sort of pig over there. But now I began
to think.</p>
<p>I was thinking heavily when I put on my hat, but when I reached
the premises of the Patriot Pigs I was thinking things that I
prefer not to talk about. To begin with, they were housing the poor
little beasts in a place you wouldn't dream of inflicting on the
poorest labourer. And the overcrowding! And the dirt! And the pigs
themselves! They were positively uncanny. There was something
almost human about them. They were all heads and no bodies. It was
just as though the other half of the wits of the half-witted boy
who looked after them had distributed itself among the whole herd.
I could have wept when I thought how my purse and my swill-tub had
been emptied to keep such puny monstrosities in the land of the
living.</p>
<p>I had my pig taken out and weighed. He turned the scale at
forty-eight pounds.</p>
<p>A week later I went and weighed him again; he had shrunk to
forty.</p>
<p>I am a man of action. In a flash my mind was made up. I put him
on a string and led him home.</p>
<p>My wife seemed rather surprised when we entered the
drawing-room, but I hastened to explain.</p>
<p>"I paid five pounds," I said, "for a five-pound pig. Since then
I 've paid fifty-five pounds more, and I have been led to expect,
that at the very least the pig was keeping pace. But it isn't. The
sterling is increasing by leaps and bounds; the avoirdupois is not
even stationary. That's not counting several tons of swill that
ought to be inside him but aren't. It can't go on." I paused and
added darkly, "That pig shall not return."</p>
<p>"But surely you're not going to have him live with <i>us</i>,
Henry?"</p>
<p>I controlled myself.</p>
<p>"No, Maria," I said, "I am not. At a late hour to-night we will
take him out into the country and lose him."</p>
<p>"Oh, Henry," she began, "supposing&mdash;"</p>
<p>I interrupted gently but firmly.</p>
<p>"My mind," said I, "like BERT COOTE'S, is made up. He is my pig
and I may do what I like with him. There is no law against one
losing one's pig. Besides, he is ruining me."</p>
<p>At 10 P.M. we set out <i>en famille</i>. It was July. I remember
the date rather particularly because it was just then that they
ceased to ration bacon altogether. At 10.30 the pig was safely
lost. At 11 the front-door closed upon us. At 11.1 little Willy
Perkins, the butcher's son, arrived with the pig and claimed
something for restoring lost property.</p>
<p>A man with a position to keep up simply can't afford to be
caught in the act of feloniously making away with pigs in war-time;
besides DORA was still alive and she might have something to say;
so I had to pretend how pleased I was, and I gave the scamp
half-a-crown.</p>
<p>Now I know Perkins and Son well enough to realise that if the
animal had been worth more than half-a-crown they would have
allowed me to lose my pig free of charge. So I made another
resolution. It was pretty drastic, but in a crisis like this severe
measures are often the best. In short, it was murder I
contemplated&mdash;nothing less.</p>
<p>I went to work carefully. I let four months slip by to allay any
possible suspicion. I paid my weekly cheque without being asked;
without a murmur I parted daily with my swill; in fact I comported
myself as though the unholy plot maturing in my breast was
nonexistent.</p>
<p>At length the night arrived. I took down my long magazine Lee
Enfield and my cartridge (I am not a Volunteer for nothing) and
crept to the Patriot Pig H.Q.</p>
<p>The once-crowded sty lay dark and still. I entered and switched
on my torch: it shone on the loathsome features that I knew so
well. He was all alone, so there could be no mistake. His head was
as large as ever, but his body seemed scarcely visible. I weighed
him; he registered fourteen pounds.:</p>
<p>I will not harrow you, my reader, with details. Suffice it to
say my nerve was sure, my eye true and my hand steady. I killed
that pig with a single shot and went home to bed.</p>
<p>The Doctor arrived next morning while I was shaving. He was
white with rage. He said:</p>
<p>"What the deuce do you mean by killing my pig?"</p>
<p>"<i>Your</i> pig ?" I smiled. "No, <i>my</i> Pig!"</p>
<p>"Stuff and nonsense!" he spluttered. "<i>Your</i> pig died four
months ago&mdash;caught cold last July through being out so late at
night and died next day."</p>
<p>That roused me. "Do you mean to tell me," I asked coldly, "that
I've been paying five pounds a week for the last four months for a
dead pig?"</p>
<p>"Very kind of you, I'm sure," replied the Doctor, "but no one
asked you to, you know."</p>
<p>Adding together all my expenses&mdash;the weekly subscription
for my pig; a similar sum paid to the Doctor for his; the value of
my swill; the fine imposed (by DORA) for improper use of firearms;
ditto (by the Magistrate) for shooting game without a licence;
alleged damage to the P.P. premises and the remaining wits of their
custodian; and finally, the bill from Mr. Perkins for a pound of
pork purchased in July, and the account from Dr. Jones for
professional attendance subsequent to consumption of
same&mdash;adding all these together I find that from first to last
I disbursed &pound;385 5s. 5-1/2d. on the patriot.</p>
<p>With pork at two shillings a pound my outlay should have
produced a pig that weighed 1 ton 14-1/2 cwt. Truly that would have
been a very Hindenburg of a pig. It was almost worth trying.</p>

<h3>TO THE SPEAKER ON HIS RE-ELECTION.</h3>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Good Mr. SPEAKER, in this troublous time,</p>
<p>When it is hard to string a cheerful rhyme,</p>
<p>Your genial influence unshaken bides</p>
<p>Amid the flux of shifting sands and tides;</p>
<p>And, re-electing you by acclamation,</p>
<p>The Parliament has acted for the nation,</p>
<p>Which, while acknowledging the Members' <i>nous</i>,</p>
<p>Congratulates not you, Sir, but the House.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>'Tis fourteen years since you were called to bear</p>
<p>The heavy burdens of your "perilous Chair"&mdash;</p>
<p>What years, what burdens! Yet your steadfast mien</p>
<p>Has never failed to dominate the scene.</p>
<p>Others have found the post a giant's robe</p>
<p>Or lacked the needful patience of a Job;</p>
<p>But you, by dint of fearless common sense,</p>
<p>Have won and held all Parties' confidence;</p>
<p>Firm as the rock and as the crystal clear,</p>
<p>When need arises righteously austere,</p>
<p>Ready, not eager, your advice to lend,</p>
<p>And not afraid in season to unbend.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Thus, tested by a strain that very few,</p>
<p>If any, of your predecessors knew,</p>
<p>You come at last, among the lesser fry,</p>
<p>To loom so largely in the public eye,</p>
<p>That, we regard you, greatest of your clan,</p>
<p>More as an institution than a man.</p>

<p>THE RETURN.</p>
<p>It was at tea last Sunday that we met for the first time for
three-and-a-half years. He was sadly altered. To the casual
observer he may still appear his own attractive self; the change in
him is deeper.</p>
<p>He isn't what he was, but none the less it is wonderfully
delightful to have him among us again. A girl at the next table
noticed him and spoke smilingly to her companion. But I&mdash;I sat
and looked at him and never said a word.</p>
<p>Before the War I was fond of him, but I doubt if I could ever
have realised how much I should miss him; and nothing has brought
home to me so surely the astounding fact that at last it is over as
his return.</p>
<p>Sitting opposite to him here brought back the jolly memories of
other teas in that distant pre-war life of ours&mdash;memories of
bright faces, gentle clatter of cups, charm of soft clothes,
strange forgotten sense of comforts, and one particular smile; and,
throwing off from me the gathering gloom of the war-weary, I dug my
fork joyously into his brown bosom and raised the chocolate
<i>&eacute;clair</i> to my lips.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Captain Edwin Peck, E.N.,</p>
<p>Had the habits of a hen.</p>
<p>Edwin's nose was like a bone,</p>

<p>Neither, I regret to tell,</p>
<p>Did they fit him very well.</p>
<p>It was not his fault, no doubt,</p>
<p>That they tried to tumble out,</p>
<p>And in fact he seldom dropped them,</p>
<p>For he almost always copped them</p>

<p>By ejaculating, "Cluck."</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Yoked to this elusive plate,</p>

<p>He must needs examine it,</p>
<p>Not as any other might,</p>
<p>Standing at his proper height,</p>
<p>But with body slightly slanted</p>

<p>Poked his head out through the port.</p>

<h2>THE MUD LARKS.</h2>
<p>One reads a lot nowadays about the "slavery" of various habits
(drug, drink, bigamy, etc.) and loud is the outcry. But there is
yet another bondage, just as binding and far more widespread, which
nobody ever seems to mention, namely, the drill habit. Drill the
young soldier up in the way he should go and for ever after his
body will spring to the word of command, whether his soul approves
or no.</p>
<p>Once upon a time two men turned up in a railway construction
camp deep in the Rhodesian bush. They were a silent, furtive,
friendless pair, dwelling apart, and nobody could discover whence
they came, whither they were bound, or, in fact, anything about
them. It was generally conceded that they had some horrid secret to
bury (camp optimists voted for "murder") and left it at that. Time
went by and so did the rail-head, leaving the two mysteries behind
as permanent-way gangers. Solitude seemed to suit them. Years
passed along and still the two remained in that abomination of
desolation guarding their stretch of track and their horrid secret.
Then one day ROBERTS rolled by on his way to Victoria Falls, and,
his train halting to tank-up, the old Field-Marshal stepped ashore
and called to the two gangers, who happened to be close at hand
tinkering at their trolley. The guard, who was taking a bottle of
Bass with the steward on the platform of the diner, suddenly jabbed
his friend in the brisket.</p>
<p>"Look, for the love of Mike!" he giggled.</p>
<p>The two gangers were standing talking to "BOBS," shoulder to
shoulder, heels together, feet spread at an angle of forty-five
degrees, knees braced, thumbs behind the seams of their trousers,
backs hollowed, heads erect&mdash;in short in the correct position
of attention as decreed in the Book of Infantry Training. The old
man finished speaking and the two saluted smartly and broke away.
The steward looked at his friend and nodded, "Old soldiers."</p>
<p>"Old deserters, you mean," retorted the guard. "<i>Now</i> we
know."</p>
<p>The drill habit had been too strong for those two fugitives even
after ten years.</p>
<p>The other night our Babe, as Orderly Officer, sat up alone in
the Mess, consuming other people's cigarettes and whisky until
midnight, then, being knocked up by the Orderly Sergeant, gave the
worthy fellow a tot to restore circulation, pulled on his gum-boots
and sallied forth on the rounds. By 12.45 he had assured himself
that the line guards were functioning in the prescribed "brisk and
soldierly manner," and that the horses were all properly tucked up
in bed, and so turned for home.</p>
<p>He paused at the cross-roads to hear the end of the Sergeant's
reminiscences of happy days when he, the Sergeant, (then
full-private, full in more senses than one) had held the
responsible position of beer-taster to a regiment at Jaipurbad ("an
ideal drinkin' climate, Sir"), then, dismissing the old
connoisseur, continued on his way bedward.</p>
<p>It must have been one o'clock by then, a black wind-noisy night.
As the Babe turned into the home straight, he saw a light flash for
an instant in a big cart-shed opposite the Mess&mdash;just a
flicker as of a match scratched and instantly extinguished.</p>
<p>This struck him as curious; it was no weather or hour for decent
folk to be abroad. The Babe then remembered that the mess-cart was
in the shed, and it occurred to him that somebody might be
monkeying with the harness. He thereupon marched straight for the
shed (treading quite noiselessly in his gum-boots) and, pulling out
his electric torch, flashed it, not on some cringing Picard
peasant, as he had expected, but on three unshorn, unwashed,
villainous, whopping big Bosch infantrymen! It would be difficult
to say who was the most staggered for the moment, the Huns blinking
in the sudden glare of the torch or the Babe well aware that he was
up against a trio of escaped and probably quite desperate prisoners
of war. "Victory," says M. HILAIRE BELLOC (or was it NAPOLEON? I am
always getting them mixed) "is to him who can bring the greatest
force to bear on a given position." That is as may be, but, after
personal participation in one or two of the major disputes in the
late lamented war, I put it this way. Two opposing factions bump,
utter chaos reigns supreme and the side which recovers first wins.
In this case the Babe was the first to recover. A year before the
War he found himself in a seminary in the suburbs of Berlin,
learning to cough his vowels, roll his r's and utter German
phonetically. Potsdam was near at hand, and many a pleasant hour
did the Babe spend on a bench outside the old Stadt Palast,
watching young recruits of the Prussian Guard having their souls
painfully extracted from them by <i>Feldwebels</i> of great muzzle
velocity and booting force. The sight of those three Hun uniforms
standing before him must have pricked a memory, which in turn set
some sub-conscious mechanism to work, for suddenly the Babe heard a
voice bawling orders in German. It was fully five seconds, he
swears, before he recognised it as his own. "Attention!" snarled
the voice in proper Potsdammer style. "Quick march! Right wheel!"
The three great hooligans trembled all over, clicked their heels
and stepped off the mark as punctiliously as though on the
Tempelhofer Feld at the Spring Parade.</p>
<p>In two minutes the Babe, snarling like a Zoo tiger at
dinner-time, had manoeuvred them across a hundred yards of bog and
filed them, goose-stepping, into a Nissen Hut full of sleeping
Atkinses. The Atkinses rolled, gaping, off their beds at the Babe's
first shout, and the game was up.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later the Bosch gentlemen were <i>en route</i> for
the main guard under strong, if <i>d&eacute;shabill&eacute;</i>,
escort.</p>
<p>It turned out that one of them spoke English quite badly and on
reaching the Guard Room he opened out.</p>
<p>They had escaped from a prison camp at Abbeville, he said, and
were heading for Holland, travelling by night.</p>
<p>Passing the farm at about midnight they espied our hooded
mess-cart and, feeling tired and footsore, had conceived the bright
idea of stealing a horse to fit the cart and driving to Holland in
style and comfort. Just as they were getting things shipshape along
came the Babe and clapped the lid on&mdash;"<i>verfluchte kleine
Teufel</i>!"</p>
<p>When the Main Guard lads inquired how it was that after all
their trouble they had allowed one lone unarmed infant to corral
the three of them, instead of quietly biffing him on the head, as
they quite easily might have done, the Huns were very confused. At
one moment they were in the shed, they said, fascinated like moths
in the glare of the torch, and the next thing they knew they were
in the midst of a horde of underclothed Tommies&mdash;trapped. As
to what had happened in the interval, or how they had been spirited
from one place to the other, they were not in the least
clear&mdash;couldn't explain it at all.</p>

<h3>THE BET.</h3>
<p>The Colonel was, as usual, laying down the law.</p>
<p>"Economy!" he said with a snort; "economy's dead. No one cares
about saving money any more. No one cares about the value of money.
We are asked excessive prices and we pay them. We eat, drink and
are merry&mdash;or approximately so&mdash;and be hanged to you!
With the exception of the halfpenny stamp we put on circulars I can
think of nothing that has not gone up or, in other words, lost
buying power. I defy anyone to name a thing that hasn't."</p>
<p>He glowered fiercely and challengingly around.</p>
<p>"I repeat," he said, "that the purchasing power of money is not
what it was in any respect. The other day, for instance, I bought a
new hat. I used to pay a guinea; it is now thirty-two and six. And
a worse hat probably. What do you think I was charged for soling
and heeling shoes? One pound ten! And worse leather. That's partly
what I mean by the loss of purchasing power; where the price may in
some extraordinary way remain the same, the quality of the article
paid for is inferior. There's a steady deterioration. Can anyone
name a case where I am wrong?"</p>
<p>His red eyes again defied us.</p>
<p>"Yes, I can," said a meek voice.</p>
<p>The Colonel subjected the speaker to a long and ferocious
scrutiny.</p>
<p>"You can'?" he said at last.</p>
<p>"Yes," replied the meek voice. "Will you bet on it?"</p>
<p>"Bet on it? Most certainly I will," said the Colonel, who has
done fairly well in wagers in his time. "How much?"</p>
<p>"What you like," replied the meek voice.</p>
<p>"Very well," said the Colonel, "make it a tenner."</p>
<p>"With pleasure," was the rejoinder. "The bet is that I can't
name a single thing which has not either increased in price or
decreased in quality since the War?"</p>
<p>"Yes," said the Colonel.</p>
<p>We all sat up and waited, as though for the maroons in the old,
old days.</p>
<p>"Well," said the meek voice, "the cost of pulling a
communication cord is I still five pounds, and you can have just as
good a pull as ever."</p>

<p>MR. LOWTHER TAKES THE CHAIR FOR "POSITIVELY THE LAST TIME." HIS
ENTHUSIASTIC PROPOSER AND SECONDER (COLONEL MILDMAY AND SIR HENRY
DALZIEL), BITTEN BY THE POPULAR CRAZE, PUT A BIT OF "JAZZ" INTO THE
PROCEEDINGS.]</p>
</div>
<p><i>Tuesday, February 4th</i>.&mdash;There is much virtue in
horsehair. Few who attended the informal opening of the Third
Parliament of KING GEORGE THE FIFTH would have guessed that under
the full-bottomed wig and gorgeous black-and-gold robes of the
dignified figure on the Woolsack lay the volatile personality of
"F. E." He played his new part nobly. A trifling error in the
setting of his three-cornered hat, whose rakish cock was for the
moment reminiscent of the "Galloper," was quickly corrected on the
advice of one of the Lords Commissioners at his side; and by the
time the faithful Commons were admitted to hear the Commission read
there was nothing to differentiate Lord BIRKENHEAD (as he had now
become) from any previous occupant of his exalted position. Nor was
there any lack of dignity in his delivery of the instructions to
the Commons to "proceed to the choice of some proper person to be
your Speaker"&mdash;though I fancy that when he bade them "repair
to the place where you are to sit" he must have been tempted to add
the words, "provided that you can find room there."</p>
<p>For the Lower House, when we returned there, was a seething mass
of humanity. How many of the 707 duly elected Members were present
I know not; but there were enough to swamp the floor and surge over
into the Galleries. Seeing that the "Tubes" were closed and taxis
few and far between, some of them were obliged to resort to unusual
methods of locomotion. Sir HENRY NORMAN surprised the police in
Palace Yard by arriving on a motor-scooter, and there is an
unconfirmed rumour that the Editor of <i>John Bull</i> made his
<i>rentr&eacute;e</i> to the House in a flying-boat drawn by four
<i>canards sauvages.</i> Anyhow, there they were, so thick and slab
that Mr. DE VALERA, who was reported to have escaped from durance
vile with the intention of presenting himself at the House and
creating a disturbance, would have found it impossible to gain
entry unless preceded by a charge of gelignite. As it was, none of
the Sinn Feiners was present, nor indeed any representative of
Irish Nationalism at all, and the proceedings were as orderly as a
Quaker funeral.</p>
<p>Not that they were by any means dull. For both Colonel MILDMAY,
who proposed, and Sir HENRY DALZIEL, who seconded, the re-election
of Mr. LOWTHER as Speaker, spiced their compliments with humour.
The former was confident that even if Woman appeared on the floor
of the House the SPEAKER-ELECT'S "consummate tact" would be equal
to coping with her artfullest endeavours to get round the rules of
procedure; while the latter attributed his priceless gift of humour
to "Scottish ancestry on the mother's side."</p>
<p>Horsehair again! I hardly recognised in the quietly-dressed
Member who rose from the Bench behind Ministers to acknowledge
these encomiums the man whose awe-inspiring appearance (when
clothed in wig and gown) has quelled so many storms in the last
four Parliaments. Let us hope that the fifth, of which, being the
outcome of his famous Conference, he may in a sense be described as
the "onlie begetter," will not disgrace its parentage.</p>
<p>Already there are elements of difficulty. Through the non-return
of Mr. ASQUITH the Opposition has lost its head literally and is in
some danger of losing it figuratively, for the remnant of the
un-"couponed" Liberals and the Labour Party are at present acutely
divided on the question upon whom the lost Leader's mantle should
fall. Today Sir DONALD MACLEAN, as senior Privy Councillor, took
the <i>pas</i> and was able from personal experience to give his
conception of the ideal Speaker, who "must not only have good
vision but be sometimes quite blind; not only have acute hearing
but occasionally be almost stone-deaf." Fortunately the
SPEAKER-ELECT can assume these physical defects at will; for,
despite its quiet opening, I doubt if the new Parliament when it
gets to work will prove precisely a Lowther Arcadia.</p>
<p><i>Wednesday, February 5th</i>.&mdash;To the Lords again, where
the SPEAKER-ELECT, attired in Court dress and accompanied by the
SERGEANT-AT-ARMS dandling the Mace as if it ware a refractory
infant, presented himself at the Bar to hear from the LORD
CHANCELLOR the pleasing intelligence that HIS MAJESTY was convinced
of his "ample sufficiency" to execute his arduous duties, and
readily approved his election. Thereupon Sir COLIN KEPPEL swung the
Mace on to his shoulder and escorted the SPEAKER, now confirmed in
his rank, back to the Commons.</p>
<p>There was an unusual rush of Members to take the oath. This was
not entirely due to the new Members, naturally desirous of
completing their initiatory rites, but was shared by many of the
older hands, for the good and sufficient reason that, until a
Member is certified as having been duly sworn, he cannot recover
his one hundred and fifty pounds deposit from the Returning
Officer. In their zeal to be in a position to reimburse themselves
Members crowded in such numbers to the tables that there was some
danger that they would be overturned. As one of our Latinists
remarked, "It looks as if we should have <i>novae res</i> outside
and <i>novae tabulae</i> inside."</p>
<p><i>Thursday, February 6th.</i>&mdash;The process, once
immortalized by a Lords' reporter in the sentence, "A few Bishops
looked in, swore, and went away again," went on in both Houses; but
in the Commons in a more orderly fashion than yesterday. For the
SPEAKER, ever ready, as he said on his election, "to carry out the
old rules in a modern spirit," directed the waiting Members to form
up in line. One of the Coalitionists evinced a little surprise. He
had always understood that when coupons were issued queues were
superfluous.</p>

<h3>TENDENCIES</h3>
<p>(<i>Being some extracts from the daily Press of, say,
1925).</i></p>
<p>.... The bi-monthly strike of Clyde workers took place
yesterday. The proceedings were quite orderly. The matter in
dispute this time is a very simple affair. The men, who are now
working on a full half-hour a week basis at one hundred and
sixty-eight hours' pay, with three snap meal-times of ten minutes
each per day, are not pressing for any alteration in pay or hours,
but demand the dismissal of Mr. John Smith, the managing director
of one of the large shipbuilding yards, who rudely refused to fetch
a pint of beer for one of the rivetters. The Government department
dealing with strike questions is full up for three months yet, but
hopes are entertained that, unless a critical by-election should
intervene, it will be possible to deal with the matter at the
expiration of that period.</p>
<p>.... Much interest was aroused last evening by the production of
a new musical show, both the book and music of which have been
written by natives of this country. A strong protest has been
lodged by the United States Embassy.</p>
<p>.... A passenger on one of the Tube railways alleges that he
entered a train at Oxford Circus Station last evening. No
confirmation is as yet forthcoming, and the rumour must be treated
with reserve.</p>
<p>.... The Peace Conference held a sitting yesterday and
definitely decided that the ex-Kaiser should be tried one of these
days. It is confidently stated in the inner circles of Paris that
peace will inevitably be concluded within the next ten or twelve
years.</p>
<p>.... Dancing still holds its own as the principal amusement of
the bulk of the population. The latest dance, the Guzz-Jinx, which
is danced on the hands with the right foot placed in the mouth of
one's partner, is stated to be very graceful indeed. The correct
music is provided by a band performing entirely on hair-combs and
tea-trays.</p>
<p>.... A reduction is promised in the price of tobacco shortly. An
ounce recently changed hands at a well-known Piccadilly shop at two
hundred and seven pounds, but the new season's prices are not
expected to be much above one hundred and fifty pounds.</p>
<p>A man was charged at Bow Street yesterday with endeavouring to
ride in a motor-bus on Tuesday, the 12th of the month, when his
permit was only for Thursday, the 15th of each month. He was
severely cautioned and ordered to get a new calendar.</p>

<h3>HINTS FOR THE GARDEN.</h3>
<p>To those who are about to re-establish their herbaceous borders
it will come as a welcome surprise that restrictions as to the sale
of the following foodstuffs by nurserymen have now been
withdrawn:&mdash;</p>
<p>Stucky's <i>Germania</i> (Lamb's Ear).</p>
<p><i>Scolopendrium</i> (Hart's Tongue).</p>
<p>No coupons will be required for these in future.</p>
<p><i>Fatsia Horrida.</i>&mdash;This is no longer grown by
nurserymen, but can be obtained at any butcher's, large quantities
having recently arrived from Greece. Smith minor, possibly a
prejudiced witness, says he gets it at school; that it is beastly
and only another name for Cod Liver Oil.</p>
<p><i>Sambucus</i> (the Elder).&mdash;A correspondent inquires if
anything is known of the younger branch of this family. On being
appealed to the Secretary of the Linnaean Society sent the
following <span class="pagenum"><a name="page128" id=
"page128"></a>[pg 128]</span> somewhat enigmatic telegram:
"Recommend CLEMENCEAU non-Papa, who may know something of Uncle
Sam."</p>
<p><i>Hydrangea.</i>&mdash;This hardy shrub is so called as it was
originally raised by the Ranger of Hyde Park. The American variety
"radiata" succeeds well indoors if grown on hot-water pipes.</p>
<p><i>Pirus.</i>&mdash;There are several varieties of this species.
The best known, however, comes from Cornwall and was raised by the
late Sir W.S. GILBERT, who introduced the Savoy cabbage. It is
called the <i>Pirus of Penzance</i>.</p>

<h3>DANCING DEMOBILISED.</h3>

<p>And evening dress, I've been advised,</p>
<p class="i2">Will never become transitional;</p>
<p>Yet once or twice I've been surprised</p>

<h3>LOCAL COLOUR.</h3>
<p>I ran upstairs after lunch to-day to see old Harris. He has the
flat over mine, you know. In addition to this Harris is an author.
Sometimes he even gets money for it.</p>
<p>"Doin' a bit of work to-day, Harris?" I remarked casually.</p>
<p>"I'm doing a little flying story," he informed me with
dignity.</p>
<p>"Oh, yes," I agreed carelessly, then woke up and stared
hard.</p>
<p>"Flying?" I repeated. "But what the&mdash;I mean, what do you
know about flying, anyway?"</p>
<p>Brutality is the only thing with Harris. He was very hurt. He
gasped and glared at me in a most annoyed manner.</p>
<p>"I know a pretty good lot," he announced with some asperity.
"I've talked to dozens of pilots about it and I've read books on
flying&mdash;and the newspapers&mdash;"</p>
<p>"And don't forget you once passed Hendon in the train too, old
son," I soothed him. "I'd no idea you were so well up in it. Sorry
I spoke. Let's see it; may I?"</p>
<p>Harris picked up a couple of sheets of paper from the desk and,
coughing imposingly, proceeded to read out his
masterpiece:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Lionel Marchant came slowly out of the hangar, drawing on his
long fur gloves and studying his maps with an intent and keen
face.</p>
<p>"His machine, a single-seater scout of the latest type, was just
being wheeled out and now stood glistening in the bright autumn
sunshine, which danced on the shining brasswork and threw deep
shadows on the grass beneath.</p>
<p>"The airman swung lightly into his seat; a final word or two
with his commanding officer and he flung over the levers and gave a
sharp turn to the starting handle.</p>
<p>"The powerful engine in front of him woke into life deafeningly
and, waving away the mechanics holding the wings, he pressed the
clutch pedal and moved slowly forward.</p>
<p>"His face is very grim and determined&mdash;he throws across
another lever and the low hum of the motor changes into a
deep-throated roar. Gathering speed, he goes faster and
faster&mdash;now he is in the air&mdash;now a little speck in the
sky, heading for the enemy's lines&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, no, please," I broke in feebly. "I can't stand any more
just now. You're not seriously thinking of having this published,
are you?"</p>
<p>As in a dream I took the manuscript from his fingers and gazed
blankly at it whilst his indignant flow of speech passed harmlessly
over my head.</p>
<p>"But, Harris," I said at length, with infinite compassion in my
voice, "Harris, I love you as a brother, but this really is
awful&mdash;why&mdash;well, listen here"&mdash;</p>
<p>"'As the second German machine came down on them in a steep dive
Lionel gave a hasty glance behind him, where the huge engine raced
madly, and shouted excitedly to his observer.</p>
<p>"'The latter, swinging the machine gun round sharply, took rapid
aim and pressed the trigger&mdash;'"</p>
<p>I stopped.</p>
<p>"Well?" demanded the author icily.</p>
<p>"No, it's too frightful," I bleated. "Harris, this <i>might</i>
conceivably be read by a real pilot. Heaven forbid, of course! And
he'd simply hate this scout 'bus with the engine ahead to change
into a 'pusher' two-seater in six paragraphs."</p>
<p>Harris was routed, absolutely demoralised. "They told me to put
in lots of flying talk," he murmured abjectly, "and tons of local
colour to make it lifelike."</p>
<p>"Yes," I said grimly, "but this colour's too local for
words."</p>
<p>"Of course, if you think you could do it better yourself,"
Harris observed with heavy sarcasm, "well, then&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Certainly," I agreed heartily. "I don't mind showing
<i>you</i>, Harris, seeing you're a pal of mine. Just pass the ink
and let your uncle get to work."</p>
<p>Behold my effort!&mdash;</p>
<p>"'Orderly, what about tea?'</p>
<p>"'Very nearly ready, Sir.'</p>
<p>"'Right. Then I think a small piece of toast is indicated;' and
he proceeded to hack the loaf to pieces with great vigour.</p>
<p>"'Hun over somewhere, sounds like,' said a sleepy voice as the
throb of an engine was heard overhead.</p>
<p>"'Oh, I can't help his troubles,' observed the toast-maker
airily. 'He's got no right to come at tea-time. In about
half-an-hour or so I might think about&mdash;'</p>
<p>"Here the telephone bell rang.</p>
<p>"'Now that's a splendid joke,' said his unfeeling friend as he
laid down the receiver. 'You've got to go up after that chap.
They're getting your 'bus out now, so&mdash;'</p>
<p>"'What!' came in disgusted tones from the fireside. 'Don't be so
dam funny. What do you mean?'</p>
<p>"'Not ragging, really, Bill. The C.O. said he wanted you to have
a shot at that fellow. Run like a hare. You may catch him up over
Berlin somewhere. I'll eat your toast for you.'</p>

"'Oh, will you?' grunted the other. 'What awful rot it is! Oh, the
devil&mdash;where's my hat?' and out he plunged.<br />
<br />
<p>"Two minutes later he was struggling into a heavy leather coat
and, feeling thoroughly ill-used, climbed into his machine.</p>
<p>"The propeller was swung, emitting one hollow cough.</p>
<p>"'Switch off. All right, contact.'</p>
<p>"At the third attempt the engine remembered its manners and
started up with a jerk. A few moments to get her running smoothly,
a rapid test to see that she was 'giving her revs.' and the chocks,
were waved away from the wheels.</p>
<p>"Within twenty yards he was off the ground and, throttle wide
open, climbing towards the little white dot thousands of feet
above.</p>
<p>"And all the time he was grumbling.</p>
<p>"'What awful rot it is! I've about as much chance of reaching
the blighter as ... Running my engine to bits as it is ... May be
able to cut him off when he's dropped his eggs.'</p>
<p>"Which is precisely what happened. The last gift had been
thankfully received in a ploughed field beneath and the Hun was
turning for home when the scout struggled to his level.</p>
<p>"The watchers on the ground saw the small machine press
determinedly towards the bigger and a faint crackle of gun-fire
broke out.</p>
<p>"It was answered by all the guns on board the enemy craft and
the single-seater wavered undecidedly.</p>
<p>"Then he got his adversary fairly in his ring sight again and'
risking everything, fired burst after burst.</p>
<p>"All at once the big machine heeled over and dived&mdash;a flash
and a sudden sheet of flame from the engine and down dropped the
raider, to dash to pieces in the French fields three miles
below.</p>
<p>"Ten minutes later the British machine slithered on to the
ground and switched off in front of the sheds.</p>
<p>"'By Jove, Bill,' said his friend, rushing up excitedly, 'that
was the best show&mdash;'</p>
<p>"'Not so much of it,' interposed the 'hero,' scrambling out of
his seat. 'What about my tea? Did you look after my toast for me?
No, might have known you wouldn't.'"</p>

<h2>THE BLANKET ASTRAY.</h2>
<p>Now that most of us are on the point of escaping into civil
life, the relentless department to whom the W.O. entrusted the
stewardship of Army blankets is calling us to strict account as to
our dealings with these articles.</p>
<p>Between us and freedom rise the accusing phantoms of blankets we
signed for and failed to return, blankets we misused as carpets,
curtains and table-cloths. The bright dawn of the new era is
overcast by their threatening shadow.</p>
<p>The A.A.L.R.B.G.S.&mdash;Acting-Assistant Local Recorder of
Blankets General Service, a very important Hat indeed&mdash;some
time last winter paid us a visit and went away without complaint.
We had specialised in cherishing Blankets G.S. For fear of loss or
damage none had been issued for use, and the enthusiasm of all
ranks was so warm that the men were glad to sleep without them, if
only they might go and see for themselves the full tally of
blankets folded correctly to a hair's-breadth and piled
irreproachably and unapproachably in the stores.</p>
<p>Then, three days ago, arrived a chit asking us to explain a curt
quotation from the report of the A.A.L.R.B.G.S., to the effect
that</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"<i>There was a blanket on the table</i></p>
<p>in the store."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>By a civilian this might be interpreted as a word of praise for
our care of the table or for the comfortable <i>tout ensemble</i>
of the Quartermaster-Sergeant's treasure-house; but we know better.
We read it with the sensations of a householder who, after the call
of a Scotland Yard official, should be invited to explain, in an
otherwise satisfactory account of his visit, the
sentence&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"<i>There was a corpse in the boot</i></p>
<p>cupboard."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>It suggested criticism, suspicion, disapproval. In his dilemma
the O.C. replied as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Owing to the fact that, in view of the paper scarcity, the
keeping of Individual History Sheets for the Blankets under my
command was discontinued early in the War, I have found it
difficult to collect evidence. I beg, however, to submit the
likeliest explanations that offer.</p>
<p>"(1) Possibly the blanket was placed on the table, folded and
compressed beneath the weight of the various utensils, literature
and stationery necessary to the functioning of a B.Q.M.S., in order
that the correct regimental wrinkles, as laid down in the various
handbooks, might be made and maintained; the blanket to be used as
a model at lectures to young soldiers on the care of equipment.</p>
<p>"(2) The distance between the Main Blanket Dump and the table
under suspicion is only four feet. It is in the experience of all
familiar with conditions in the Field that blankets with long
service frequently develop extreme activity. I beg to suggest that
the blanket in question may have absented itself without leave from
the main dump and proceeded as far as the table by its own
locomotive power.</p>
<p>"(3) About the date of the inspection the name of an N.C.O. was
submitted with a recommendation for the O.B.E., but was withdrawn
on compassionate grounds. I cannot trust my memory, but possibly
the justification of this recommendation was the N.C.O.'s zealous
care of the property of H.M. THE KING, in that he sacrificed his
own blanket for the welfare of the table." (On paper, of course,
our blankets are issued in the normal way.) "The weather at the
time was inclement, either (<i>a</i>) wet and dirty or (<i>b</i>)
extremely cold. The N.C.O. was determined that this table should be
protected from the deleterious effects of (<i>a</i>) moisture
likely to result from the vicinity of the Q.M.S., damp from
out-door duties or (<i>b</i>) very low temperature, which is known
to injure such articles of furniture.</p>
<p>"(4) The blanket may have been known to be likely to try to
escape from custody, and have been placed conspicuously on the
table so as to be directly under the observation of the Q.M.S.</p>
<p>"(5) The table may have intended illegally to absent itself
without leave, and have concealed itself beneath the accused
blanket in the hope of eluding the vigilance of the sentries,
disguised as a civilian table, i.e. covered with a table-cloth.
This theory is unlikely, the table bearing an excellent character
and never having been known to attempt desertion or be in any way
guilty of conduct contrary to good order and military
discipline.</p>
<p>"(6) The Storeman&mdash;now demobilised and dispersed&mdash;may
have committed the irregularity suggested, with the idea of
increasing the amenity of the stores during the inspection, as a
humble compliment to the A.A.L.R.B.G.S.</p>
<p>"(7) No. 55,442, Procter, Mary, a member of the Q.M.A.A.C., may
be correct in her statement that the article described as a
'blanket' was not a blanket, but a rug, travelling. She says she is
'in a position to know this,' as the article is her own property,
and supports the claim by demonstrating the presence of her
initials embroidered across one corner.</p>
<p>"I await your reply." And so we all do.</p>

<h3>A MASTER OF GROTESQUE.</h3>
<p>The Leicester Galleries for laughter just now! For the walls of
the inner room are hung with drawings by Mr. H.M. BATEMAN, not a
few of which&mdash;such as "The Leave Wangler," and "The Man who
Clung to the Railings," and "The Infectious Hornpipe"&mdash;have
already rejoiced the readers of <i>Punch</i>.</p>
<p>Mr. BATEMAN'S appeal is double, for, having enjoyed his broad or
subtle farce and his keen satirical observations, one may turn to
the admiration of his technique, or <i>vice vers&acirc;*</i>. He
did not invent the idea of the humorous sequence&mdash;the
accumulative pictorial comedy; CARAN D'ACHE had come before, and
before CARAN D'ACHE was WILHELM BUSCH, the German; but he has made
it his own to-day. Some of his series are irresistible. As a
delineator of types, accurate beneath the caricature, he is deadly;
particularly, perhaps, when he turns his attention to the Senior
Service. But his Brigadiers and his Clubmen are also always within
an ace of being identifiable.</p>
<p>For anyone in the dumps Mr. Punch prescribes a speedy visit to
the Leicester Galleries.</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>
<h4><i>(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)</i></h4>
<p>MR. JOHN GALSWORTHY is a most deceptive writer. He lures a
reader on by a display of gentleness and smoothness and moderation,
and then turns on him and makes it plain that he is really a most
provocative fellow and is engaged in matching his mind against
yours. He tries to commit you to some such statement as this: "The
allegiance of the workman in time of peace is not rendered to the
State, but to himself and his own class." Or this: "I think
editors, journalists, old gentlemen and women will be brutalised
[by the War] in larger numbers than our soldiers." Or this: "This
is at once a spiritual link with America and yet one of the great
barriers to friendship between the two peoples. We are not sure
whether we are better men than Americans." Or this: "My mind is
open, and when one says that, one generally means that it is shut."
Disconcerting, very, and all to be found in <i>Another Sheaf</i>
(HEINEMANN). Mr. GALSWORTHY'S chief object in his little book is to
arouse us to the disgrace and destruction of our State and race if
we continue to allow ourselves to be fed, not by our own resources,
but by alien corn and meat, which may so easily become hostile corn
and meat. Incidentally Mr. GALSWORTHY finds that we are in the mass
far too ugly. For instance, how few of us have chiselled nostrils!
We ought not to eat so much pure white flour.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>On the second page of <i>The Secret City</i> (MACMILLAN) Mr.
HUGH WALPOLE (or, to be meticulously correct, <i>Durward</i>, into
whose mouth the story is put) says that "there is no Russian alive
for whom this book can have any kind of value except as a happy
example of the mistakes that the Englishman can make about the
Russian." Well, after finishing the book, which is in some ways a
sequel to <i>The Dark Forest</i>, I felt so very disinclined to
believe this statement that I consulted a Russian, who is very much
alive, and received the opinion that, if Mr. WALPOLE has not
succeeded in drawing the real average Russian, he has given us a
type whose faults and virtues sound the keynote of the situation as
it is to-day. Such an opinion is worth a thousand times more than
any judgment of mine, and I am glad of the opportunity to record
it. From a literary point of view it seems to me that Mr. WALPOLE,
in allowing <i>Durward</i> to tell the tale, has created
innumerable difficulties for himself&mdash;difficulties which to a
great extent have been cleverly overcome, but which nevertheless
make the story wobble dangerously and once or twice threaten it
with devastation. To me, however, the interest never really
flagged, for granted that one has a sympathy with Russia one feels
acutely what Mr. WALPOLE is aiming at and how wonderfully he
succeeds. It is not difficult to find faults: to complain, for
instance, that a strong man like <i>Semyonov</i> would not have
taken such elaborate measures to get himself killed; but these
points are trivial in a book which is not to be read so much for
its story as for its idea. And the idea is great.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p><i>Rollo Johnson</i> was incautious enough to be born the
natural son of a peer. This fact caused just sufficient
complications to keep MARY L. PENDERED'S latest story, <i>The
Silent Battlefield</i> (CHAPMAN AND HALL), from any threat of
stagnation while she was developing the theme that really intrigued
her. This was the struggle between increasing wealth and
early-acquired Socialism as it arose in the mind of a hero working
his way up from poverty to millionairedom, a seat in the House and
the opportunity of hobnobbing with lords, suffragettes and other
notables. When I say that the two sides of the Socialist case are
presented <span class="pagenum"><a name="page132" id=
"page132"></a>[pg 132]</span> with rather uncommon fairness you may
think that is only because my own particular creed is upheld; but
really and truly I was frowning quite as much as purring while the
silent battle proceeded, and the end is neutral enough to bring
despair to all true believers. Lest you should suppose the book all
made up of election addresses I hasten to add that, in the quiet
and thoughtful way one expects of the author, the story is a good
one, the pictures of a small country town are true to life, and the
characters without exception real creatures of flesh and blood.
Remembering the puppets that so often have been made to represent
their country in a political novel, this is saying more than a
little, and if it is true that, among the ladies of the cast, one
still finds those the most attractive who have no pronounced
opinions to speak or vote about, no doubt this is just old
prejudice, and, anyway, the book is one that can be heartily
commended.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>The scene of <i>In Happy Valley</i> (HODDER AND STOUGHTON) is
laid spiritually, if not strictly geographically, in that part of
the continent of America which everybody who has gone to a cinema,
hoping against hope, knows so well. I mean the country where people
have "shooting irons" and use them on the slightest provocation to
insist that other people shall carry their hands at an absurd and
wearisome elevation, and all the men wear fringy trousers, and all
the women shawls, save the heroine, who has to be suitably arrayed
for the performance of athletic feats. I admit that I didn't feel
quite at home <i>In Happy Valley</i>, because I missed the sheriff
and his posse, and nobody held up the stage-coach; still the young
doctor and the school teacher and the ladies at the mission did
their best for me, and I found it a great help to know the
language, an attainment of which I am justifiably a little vain,
for not everyone could translate at sight to "thud" the road or
"shoot up" a Christmas party. Mr. JOHN FOX, Junr., has not placed
his largest strawberries&mdash;and some of them are quite nice
ones&mdash;at the top of the basket. His first story did not
attract me as much as others further on, such as, for instance,
that excellently humorous one, "The Angel from Viper," though here
and in other places a lady called <i>St. Hilda</i>, obviously not
she of Whitby, confused me a little. I fancy that we were supposed
to have made her acquaintance in some previous book. But my real
quarrel with Mr. Fox is that he has only given walking-on parts to
the actors who do best when such tales are told upon the
screen&mdash;I mean the horses.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>When it is granted that books on flying by fliers have at
present a peculiar fascination, the fact still remains that what I
will call The Library of Aviation has usually been remarkably
fortunate in its contributors. <i>Cavalry of the Air</i> (SIMPKIN,
MARSHALL) is the last flying work which it has been my good fortune
to read, and the only conceivable reason for finding fault with it
is that "FLIGHT COMMANDER" occasionally becomes a little facetious.
But when that small complaint is made I have nothing left except
praise. The author was first of all an Observer&mdash;or, as he
calls it, a "Shock Absorber"&mdash;in France, and he describes his
life so that we groundlings may understand and sympathise with
every phase of it. Especially I like the way in which he pays
tribute to the infantry. In the second part of his book he tells us
of his training as a pilot; and here he gives information which
deserves to be most thoroughly studied. The illustrations by Mr.
GEOFFREY WATSON add to the charm of this attractive volume. Of
another contribution to the literature of the air which lies before
me I cannot speak so well. Lieut.-Colonel CURTIES has an inventive
mind, and in <i>Blake of the R.F.C.</i> (SKEFFINGTON) he uses it
unsparingly. But although I am ready to believe almost anything in
a book of this kind, I am bound to confess that I found myself
bewildered by this breathless romance. Indeed the pace is so hot at
the outset that even the author seems to have lost control of it.
If, however, you are craving for excitement you will find it here.
The scene is laid in Cairo, and we all know that funny things
happen in that city. Not the least funny thing that happened to the
characters in this story was the careless ease with which they
drank whisky-and-soda. But this&mdash;let me warn
you&mdash;happened nearly two years ago.</p>

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06">http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
